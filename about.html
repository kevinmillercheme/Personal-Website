        <h1 id="h1About">About Me</h1>
        <p id="pAbout">Software engineering can get robotic. Here's a look at my real life. Some of my favorite things include weightlifting, eating, and sports.</p>
        <h2 id="h2About">Weightlifting</h2>
        <img id="h2Img" src="boys.jpeg"/>
        <p id="pAbout">Me and some of the morning crew guys at Norm's Gym. Weightlifting has been an incredibly valuable tool during college and beyond, waking up early and crushing a lift helped with my discipline surrounding school and work, and I've made countless friends at the gym regardless where I'm located.</p>
        <h2 id="h2About">Eating</h2>
        <img id="h2Img" src="francese.jpeg"/>
        <p id="pAbout">A top-tier chicken francese from Brass City Bistro in Waterbury, CT. I suppose it goes along with the lifting, but I love to eat. And theres endless good food in CT. It's known for its pizza but I'd say theres way better here. Sushi, Italian, Chinese, Indian. Doen't matter I'm crushing it I love eating.</p>
        <h2 id="h2About">Sports</h2>
        <img id="h2Img" src="yankee.jpeg"/>
        <p id="pAboutNoLine">Opening day 2025 at Yankee Stadium. To callback to the rage baiting on the home page, the yankees were playing the Milwaukee Brewers for the home opener. I, a huge Freddy Peralta fan who was the Brewer's ace at the time, wore my Freddy Peralta jersey knowing my friends and I had bleacher seats. Peralta let up a leadoff homerun to catcher Austin Wells and I had about $60 in stadium beer poured on my head by the surrounding Yankee fans. New York is a special place, those fans will genuinely want to fight you for wearing the opposing teams jersey (happened twice that day lol). I loved it.</p>
